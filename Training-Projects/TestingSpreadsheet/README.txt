What's included in the tests?

1. How many products per Supplier
2. Total value of inventory per supplier
3. Products with less than 10 in the inventory

BONUS:
Add a 5th row to the spreadsheet with the calculated value of a product while multiplying with its inventory count.

As you know, there are different ways to work with files. I could use io module, but i went with a Python package named openpyxl [https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/]
It has lots of special functionalities for spreadsheets and a useful documentation [https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]
